# FundraisingCampaign Smart Contract - Complete User Guide

## What is This Contract?

The FundraisingCampaign contract is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Avalanche that allows people to raise money for projects, causes, or businesses. Think of it as a blockchain-powered version of Kickstarter or GoFundMe, but with some unique features that make it more secure and transparent.

When someone creates a campaign, they set a funding goal and a deadline. People can contribute USDC (a stable cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar) to support the campaign. In return, contributors receive special tokens that represent their share in the project **and give them voting power in the resulting DAO**. If the campaign reaches its goal, the creator gets the funds and a decentralized autonomous organization is formed where all contributors can participate in governance decisions. If not, contributors can get their money back.

**The key innovation**: This isn't just crowdfunding - it's community-driven governance. Every contributor becomes a stakeholder with voting rights in the project's future direction.

## Key Features That Make This Special

### 1. **Anti-Whale Protection**
This isn't just a fancy term - it's a real protection mechanism. Imagine if a billionaire could come in and buy 90% of your campaign in one go, leaving little room for regular supporters. The contract prevents this by setting limits on how much any single person can contribute.

### 2. **Share Tokenization with DAO Governance**
When you contribute to a campaign, you don't just give money away. You receive tokens that represent your stake in the project and **voting power within the DAO**. These tokens give you the right to participate in governance decisions about the project's direction, fund allocation, and strategic choices. Your tokens literally represent your voice in the decentralized autonomous organization that forms around successful campaigns.

### 3. **Automatic Refund System**
If a campaign doesn't reach its goal by the deadline, contributors can automatically get their money back. No need to trust the campaign creator to return funds - the smart contract handles it.

### 4. **Transparent and Immutable**
All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, so you can see exactly where your money goes and how the campaign is progressing. Once something is recorded, it can't be changed or hidden.

## How Campaigns Work

### Creating a Campaign

When someone wants to start a fundraising campaign, they need to provide several pieces of information:

- **Title and Description**: What the campaign is about
- **Goal Amount**: How much money they want to raise (in USDC)
- **Duration**: How long the campaign will run
- **Maximum Contribution Amount**: The most any single person can contribute
- **Maximum Contribution Percentage**: What percentage of the total goal any single person can contribute

The creator also needs to have USDC tokens to interact with the contract, and they become the owner of the campaign.

### The Campaign Lifecycle

#### Phase 1: Active Fundraising
During this phase, anyone can contribute USDC to the campaign. Here's what happens when someone makes a contribution:

1. **Validation Checks**: The contract verifies that:
   - The contributor has enough USDC in their wallet
   - They've given permission for the contract to spend their USDC
   - Their contribution doesn't exceed the maximum limits
   - The campaign is still active and hasn't passed its deadline

2. **Token Minting**: If everything checks out, the contract:
   - Transfers USDC from the contributor to the campaign
   - Mints share tokens equal to the contribution amount
   - Records the contribution in the campaign's history
   - Updates the total amount raised

3. **Automatic Completion**: If the contribution pushes the total over the goal amount, the campaign automatically completes successfully.

#### Phase 2: Campaign Completion
There are three ways a campaign can end:

**Success (Goal Reached)**
- The campaign creator can withdraw all the funds
- Contributors keep their share tokens **and DAO voting rights**
- A DAO is formed with all token holders as members
- The campaign is marked as completed

**Failure (Goal Not Reached by Deadline)**
- Contributors can request refunds of their USDC
- Their share tokens are burned (destroyed)
- The campaign creator can also withdraw any partial funds through emergency withdrawal

**Emergency Withdrawal**
- If the deadline passes and the goal wasn't reached, the creator can withdraw whatever funds were raised
- This is useful for campaigns that raised significant money but didn't quite hit their target

## Understanding the Anti-Whale Mechanism

The anti-whale system works on two levels:

### Maximum Contribution Amount
This is a hard cap on how much any single person can contribute in one transaction. For example, if this is set to $10,000, no one can contribute more than $10,000 at once.

### Maximum Contribution Percentage
This limits how much of the total goal any single person can contribute. If the goal is $100,000 and the max percentage is 10%, then no single person can contribute more than $10,000 total, even across multiple transactions.

### Why This Matters
Without these protections, a wealthy individual could:
- Dominate a campaign by contributing most of the goal
- Prevent regular supporters from participating
- Potentially manipulate the campaign's outcome

The limits ensure that campaigns remain accessible to a broad community of supporters.

## Share Tokens Explained - Your DAO Voting Power

When you contribute to a campaign, you receive "User Shares Tokens" (u-SHARE). These tokens are much more than just receipts - they're your **governance tokens for the DAO**:

- **Represent Your Stake**: Each token represents $1 USDC you contributed
- **DAO Voting Power**: Your tokens give you voting rights in the decentralized autonomous organization
- **Governance Participation**: Vote on project decisions, fund allocation, partnerships, and strategic direction
- **Proportional Influence**: The more you contribute, the more voting power you have in the DAO
- **Are Transferable**: You can send them to other people, transferring your voting rights
- **Built for Governance**: The tokens use ERC20Votes standard, designed specifically for DAO governance
- **Timestamp-Based Voting**: Uses ERC-6372 with timestamp-based checkpoints for precise and reliable governance on Avalanche
- **Can Be Burned**: If you get a refund, your tokens and voting rights are destroyed

The tokens are built using multiple Ethereum standards including **ERC20Votes** and **ERC-6372**, which are specifically designed for decentralized governance systems. The implementation uses **timestamp-based voting** rather than block numbers, ensuring precise and predictable governance periods regardless of network conditions. This makes them compatible with various DAO platforms and voting mechanisms, with improved reliability on Avalanche and Layer 2 networks.

## Security Features

### Reentrancy Protection
This prevents malicious contracts from calling the contribution function multiple times in a single transaction, which could drain funds.

### Safe Token Transfers
The contract uses OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library, which provides additional safety checks for token transfers and prevents common token-related vulnerabilities.

### Overflow Protection
All mathematical operations include checks to prevent integer overflow, which could cause unexpected behavior or fund loss.

### Access Control
Only the campaign creator can perform certain actions like withdrawing funds or updating campaign parameters. This prevents unauthorized access to campaign functions.
